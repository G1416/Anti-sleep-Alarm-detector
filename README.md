#  Anti-Sleep Alarm Detector (IoT Project)
 ## Overview
Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents.  
This project detects when the driverâ€™s eyes remain closed for too long and alerts them using a **buzzer and vibration motor**.

##  Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensor (eye blink detection)
- Buzzer
- Vibration Motor
- Jumper Wires, Breadboard, Power Supply

##  Working Principle
1. IR sensor detects whether eyes are open or closed.
2. If eyes remain closed:
   - **Buzzer** turns ON.
   - **Motor** vibrates to alert the driver.
3. When eyes open again, the system resets.
